# 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Deep Learning Image Classification Model** that identifies whether an image contains a **Cat 🐱 or Dog 🐶**.

The model is trained using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow** and image preprocessing using **OpenCV**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a **complete deep learning workflow**, including:

* Dataset preparation
* Image preprocessing
* CNN model building
* Training and validation
* Model evaluation
* Prediction on new images

# 📊 Model Architecture

The classifier is built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** consisting of:

* Convolution Layers
* MaxPooling Layers
* Flatten Layer
* Fully Connected Dense Layers
* Sigmoid Output Layer

The model predicts:

```
0 → Cat
1 → Dog
```

Because the dataset is very small, the model may sometimes misclassify images.

---

# ⚠️ Dataset Limitation

The dataset used in this project contains only:

```
10 Cat images
10 Dog images
```

Deep learning models usually require **hundreds or thousands of images** for high accuracy.

Therefore, this project is intended as a **learning demonstration of deep learning workflow** rather than a production-level model.
